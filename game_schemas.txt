game
interact w/ npcs
schemas
	race
	gender
		clothing
		appearance
			

game where you interact with other characters, choose what to say based on how you think they will react
	if they react in a way that matches what you expected, your schema is updated
		commentary on stereotypes
		educational re: brains and psych

everyone of species X is wearing plain gray clothes
	when an npc tells you how to identify a sect by their clothing, those npcs are suddenly wearing the uniform

do you want to build a schema?
	race
	gender
	clothing
	

your schema suggests that
	this npc will do X if you say A

manually adjust schema
	you now interpret this group's actions as hostile
		they will attack you
		if you imagine that they are hurting you, your HP goes down
