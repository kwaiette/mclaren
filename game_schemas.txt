game
interact w/ npcs
schemas
	race
	gender
		clothing
		appearance
			

game where you interact with other characters, choose what to say based on how you think they will react
	if they react in a way that matches what you expected, your schema is updated
		commentary on stereotypes
		educational re: brains and psych

everyone of species X is wearing plain gray clothes
	when an npc tells you how to identify a sect by their clothing, those npcs are suddenly wearing the uniform

do you want to build a schema?
	race
	gender
	clothing
	

your schema suggests that
	this npc will do X if you say A

manually adjust schema
	you now interpret this group's actions as hostile
		they will attack you
		if you imagine that they are hurting you, your HP goes down

*-*
map
	shows interactions between two "universes"
		blue on one side, orange on the other
		

X
	four corners
	where the nations meet
	asymptote
	should look like biggest point is in the middle
		another reality is pushing its way up in the middle
		making it grow at the ends, balloon
	as interaction between nations increases, the middle area increases
		less interaction decreases middle area, increases end balloon
	
types of interactions
	increase interaction between nations
		charity
		trade
		social
			concerts, dances, social functions that bring the nations together
	decrease interaction between nations
		violence
		subterfuge

have an idea
take control of npc to make idea happen
have to convince people that it's a good idea so it will get to the decision makers
	alternate model: society has a psychic link, when enough citizens agree with something, the people who execute it are immediately acting
		different nations could have different models, what gets accomplished depends on how an idea spreads through society
			strategy for psychic nation: talk to everyone
			strategy for representative democracy: talk to the people that matter
			strategy for dictatorship: talk to the people who have the ear of the dictator
				pyramid
					dictator A
						AB,AC,AD have his ear
							ABE,ABF,ABG have AB's ear
							ACH,ACI, ACJ have AC's ear
					BB,CC,DD have $INFLUENCE
					ABE,ABF,ABG have $INFLUENCE-1
					ABEK,ABEL,ABEM have $INFLUENCE-2
					ABEK==ABFM, has two lines to AB, $INFLUENCE+1

arbitrary base between digits
<-MSD, LSD->
	[0-3,0-F,0-Z,0-4]
		represent difference between digits as a percent?
		digits ABCD
			A->B = 
				A=1, => B=F
				{A| A>=B}  {A} = [0B,1B,2B,3B]  {B} = [A0,A1,A2...AF]
your intention is to be kind
you interact with npc A, a member of race A
	say something that npc A thinks is rude
		schema of that race is updated with how you think that race reacts to kindness
			my + caused A's -
				another way to see it
					my + was negated by A's background, which caused A's -
					x = -y
					x = -Ay, {A| -1<=A<=1}
	say something that npc A reacts to as if it was negative, but in A's culture that reaction is positive
		my + caused A's +
			my + caused - A's -
hierarchy
1A = 10B = 100C = 1000D
2A = 20B = 200C = 2000D
         \ 19B = 3000D
4A = 40B = 400C = 4000D
you're given 2000D, you trade it for 20B
	you trade 19B for 3000D, then trade 2000D for 20B
		you kept 1B in savings
		you traded 19B for 3000D, you now have 3000D + 1B = 3B
		you kept 

MISSION: you have to get this idea to the king
	you find out about who has the king's ear
	your reputation won't let you talk to the higher-ups
	you have to find 

	->let's host a dance with Nation B!
	<-good idea!
	-
	->let's host a dance with Nation B!
	<-isn't that dangerous? (npc thinks Nation B people are violent)
		->There will be security there, of course!

outline format
	document to master list, 1:*
	master list to child list; 1:*
	child list to child list; 1:*
	fractal
		travel between nations, create a connection between them (wormhole), put hands up because on the other side you'll be doing a handstand
			wormhole forms when a neighborhood likes a neighborhood in another nation
	links between lists

when decision maker decides against your idea, player is given a narrative for why
	I just don't think we can fit that in the budget
		[narrator] he actually didn't really like the idea so he didn't bother looking for ways to make it work
			budget: a line; a dimension
			intent: intersects with budget

other reality pushing into this one like magma forming a volcano
