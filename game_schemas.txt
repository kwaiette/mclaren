game
interact w/ npcs
schemas
	race
	gender
		clothing
		appearance
			

game where you interact with other characters, choose what to say based on how you think they will react
	if they react in a way that matches what you expected, your schema is updated
		commentary on stereotypes
		educational re: brains and psych

everyone of species X is wearing plain gray clothes
	when an npc tells you how to identify a sect by their clothing, those npcs are suddenly wearing the uniform

do you want to build a schema?
	race
	gender
	clothing
	

your schema suggests that
	this npc will do X if you say A

manually adjust schema
	you now interpret this group's actions as hostile
		they will attack you
		if you imagine that they are hurting you, your HP goes down

*-*
map
	shows interactions between two "universes"
		blue on one side, orange on the other
		

X
	four corners
	where the nations meet
	asymptote
	should look like biggest point is in the middle
		another reality is pushing its way up in the middle
		making it grow at the ends, balloon
	as interaction between nations increases, the middle area increases
		less interaction decreases middle area, increases end balloon
	
types of interactions
	increase interaction between nations
		charity
		trade
		social
			concerts, dances, social functions that bring the nations together
	decrease interaction between nations
		violence
		subterfuge

have an idea
take control of npc to make idea happen
have to convince people that it's a good idea so it will get to the decision makers
	alternate model: society has a psychic link, when enough citizens agree with something, the people who execute it are immediately acting
		different nations could have different models, what gets accomplished depends on how an idea spreads through society
			strategy for psychic nation: talk to everyone
			strategy for representative democracy: talk to the people that matter
			strategy for dictatorship: talk to the people who have the ear of the dictator

arbitrary base between digits

your intention is to be kind
you interact with npc A, a member of race A
	say something that npc A thinks is rude
		schema of that race is updated with how you think that race reacts to kindness
			my + caused A's -
				another way to see it
					my + was negated by A's background, which caused A's -
					x = -y
					x = -Ay, {A| -1<=A<=1}
	say something that npc A reacts to as if it was negative, but in A's culture that reaction is positive
		my + caused A's +
			my + caused - A's -

MISSION: you have to get this idea to the king
	you find out about who has the king's ear
	your reputation won't let you talk to the higher-ups
	you have to find 

	->let's host a dance with Nation B!
	<-good idea!
	-
	->let's host a dance with Nation B!
	<-isn't that dangerous? (npc thinks Nation B people are violent)
		->There will be security there, of course!

	fractal
		travel between nations, create a connection between them (wormhole), put hands up because on the other side you'll be doing a handstand
			wormhole forms when a neighborhood likes a neighborhood in another nation
	links between lists

when decision maker decides against your idea, player is given a narrative for why
	I just don't think we can fit that in the budget
		[narrator] he actually didn't really like the idea so he didn't bother looking for ways to make it work
			budget: a line; a dimension
			intent: intersects with budget

problem: people need welders but they don't own them
solution: provide community welders
	problems:
		people don't take care of welders, commons tragedy
			solution: hire somebody to watch welders
				problem: cost
		will put welders out of a job
			solution:
				give tax dollars to welders who make money at welding
					considerations:
						would cost taxpayers
							buy equipment
							monitor/maintain equipment
							pay pro welders

		benefits entire team
			teammates don't feel like they won
		goes on to pro league
			can be seen as
				you have to (K) in order to make it pro
				good thing pro exists to get these assholes out of here so we can enjoy our league

	ballplayers are rich but team owners are filthy rich
	

breadcrumb approach
	toss out a breadcrumb associated with current topic
	every so often, check your trail
		how did i get here?
		could i get here again given this trail?

visiual
	if i can see them, they can see me
		can they perceive me?
		even with gravitational lensing?
		assuming we're both able to detect the same frequencies 
			night, i can see them but they can't see me if i have infrared
				still blocked by LOS

	i can hear them but i can make my sounds detectable only at a shorter distance
		are others masking their sound?
smell
	shorter distance
touch/taste
	even shorter
should only trust people who taste good?
	vaginal?
		nah, plenty of bad people have sweet pussies

patterns to recognize

		1010010100101 - frequency, crosses plane at different point

	[1010101] matches [1011101] but a weaker match than [1010101]
[[patternX]...101.*[patternX]]
	matches 101 when it occurs three characters after a patternX match
		see a new pattern
