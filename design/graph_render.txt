dictionary schema
query schema before querying api
queries are stored in graph format


unitize DAS
  function code shouldn't trust parameters coming in
	describe what's expected


error handling being reported to AI
	exception
	stack trace


renderGraphAsTxt
	detect environment script is running in
	set environment in Person schema, with preferred display algorithm
	showGraphToUser -> [browser] display in browser view as html5 elements
	                 \-> [console] display in fixed-width ascii
outputString = '';
startNode, outputString += "(("+fitAndCenter(startNode.label)+"))"
//
//
renderGraph2D(person.preferredDisplayAlgorithm)
// graph -> 2D representation -> [text|html|svg]



expect
see request R coming in
	see R, expect S on entity M
	see R, probe for A on entity N

I need X service
	publish/subscribe

show prompt in English, receive response in language L
not expecting response
hypothesize
	a word in English I don't recognize
	a word in another language

here's this request, I'm going to check all of the services I can see
each
	here's this request R, should I send response S?
		yes, no, maybe
	//

algorithm for fulfilling requests for old versions
	we are running v1.5
	we got request for v1.1 someMethod()
	we determine that someMethod() doesn't use any code that was modified between v1.1 and v1.5, we can fulfill request
	OR
	code was changed in a function called by someMethod(), but not someMethod() itself
		spin up container with old version of someMethod()->otherCall()
		route someMethod()->otherCall to old version
		process
	likelihood of future requests: kill container or don't


start writing script
get a piece of it done, see some output
	what can AI learn from this progression? can unit tests be generated from this?
