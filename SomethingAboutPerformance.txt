Performance piece

Performance piece: we collectively, globally decide to reinact AJR's music video about a youtube video leading to international stardom.
Art as life, immitating art, immitating life. The recursion could cause an embalism. It's all fractal.

This leads people to base a societal philosophy around AJR's songs, a la Wyld Stalyns.

But as it turns out, AJR are a bunch of commie bastards (evidenced in Burn the House Down). Plot twist, shitheads! We tricked you into empathy!



Prove me wrong.
Show me that you can be a good parent.
