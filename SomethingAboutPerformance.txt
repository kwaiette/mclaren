Art as life, immitating art, immitating life. The recursion could cause an embalism. It's all fractal.

This leads people to base a societal philosophy around AJR's songs, a la Wyld Stalyns.

Prove me wrong.
Show me that you can be a good parent.

Design Principle #1 from Wayne's Big Book of Design: Project your idea into the future, take it to its logical conclusion. Try on a few eutopian and dystopian suits. Don't base any decisions on this, it's a logical fallacy, just do it for fun.

Meta-buisiness model: Figure out the ways of thinking that led to the existence of Gartner and similar companies. Make a fortune teaching people how to create Gartner-like companies. Better yet, devise a pyramid scheme that sells Gartner factories.
