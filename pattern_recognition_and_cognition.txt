why is pattern seeking evolutionary?
  if you can predict where food will be, you have a better chance of survival
  if you can predict what will be dangerous, you have a better chance of survival
  intelligence evolved to predict the future
  if you can see patterns in your surroundings, you can predict
    food
    predators


motivations for pattern seeking
  find a pattern, make a connection
    good!
  do not find patterns that aren't useful
    peers
      wrong
      mockery
      too simple
      not simple enough


tendency to look for the simplest explanation
  find simplicity in complexity
    take something complex and break it down into simpler parts
      observe many complex things, look for patterns
        software patterns


do neurons have "relationships"?
  if a neuron gets "mocked" by another neuron, do they "break up"?
  if neuron A mocks neuron B for being wrong
    then neuron B tells neuron C, both agree on the assessment
      both B and C mock A
    

neurons
  peer-to-peer vs heirarchical?
  peer-to-peer but they have specialization, and "expert" opinion gets weighted higher

self-awareness
  examining your own motivations
    understanding that you don't have full control over your actions
    you have some control over changing your 
next-level self-awareness:
  viewing all of your actions as the result of inputs and processing
  "you" are not the one piloting your body
    "you" are the one watching your body be piloted, "you" are evaluating the pilot's choices and making suggestions on how to improve. the pilot's mistakes are not your mistakes, but you are responsible for them.
() the level above this can only be ascertained via the types of thoughts people will have at this level
  realizing we don't have full control over our thoughts and actions
    led to 
self-awareness is pilot; next is passenger making suggestions to the pilot; next level is air traffic controller, looking at bigger picture and directing pilots
