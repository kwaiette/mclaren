the current claims about "Trump's economy" are proof of how these people think

  if he was ever diagnosed as autiscic, WE certainly can't find any record of it!
  if that universe didn't exist in the mind of that autistic child, because he wasn't really autistic and doesn't have that magic power, that can only mean that this tv universe is our own universe.

Democrats, frustrated by being outdone by left- and right-wing extremists, radicalize centrism
hypercapitalism, where the overflow from the rich goes to the poor, in the form of a Saturnalia-like ritual in which the richest 1% are forced to live like the poorest 1% for a month every year
  some near the top in the 2% avoid becoming 1%, while also contributing money to the bottom 1% just in case they do
  for the top 1% who do live like the bottom 1% for a month, it's an honor.
  insurance is sold to 2% and 3% just in case they become 1%

explaining the shape and nature of the universe
  universe is a single point and all of reality is a traversal through that point in infinite dimensions

function will be fractal
a unit with this fractal path generator exists
another unit bumps into it, slightly altering the fractal pattern of each
  since they can't actually detect a collision, each has to "imagine" what the other unit's effect on it would be if they did collide, and prepare accordingly
  the units that guessed the best would be most likely to reproduce

game
  at the beginning of the round, each unit knows the position and direction of every other unit
  each unit has a set of instructions with survival strategies
  the instructions affect the outward appearance of the units, but the units don't know which instructions the others got and no one knows the pattern of trait-to-appearance
    strategies for "trusting" another unit might include considering their position and direction, deciding if they are a threat; or looking for patterns in facial structure and compare to past experiences
    strategies for surviving: absorb energy, take energy from others
    strategies for being trusted: appear to not be a threat, look like someone who isn't a threat

universes that collided with one another annihilated each other
  particles that collided in overlapping universes annihilated each other
    only universes with very large spaces between particles were able to survive
    particles from other overlapping universes only very rarely interact with ours anymore
  particles in overlapping universes exist in orbits to avoid collision

good story telling:
  create a rule for your universe
  follow where that rule would take your characters
    rule examples:
      love at first sight exists
      time travel is possible in certain circumstances
  cross a fictional rule with a real-world ideal
    here's what would happen if time travel was possible and this horrible capitalism thing keeps going the way it is
    if love at first sight was real and veganism is the only moral way to live, here's the way things would play out
  if something isn't possible but needs to happen to advance the story, revise either the event or the rules of the universe; if the rules changed, how does that affect the other events in the story? can you retrofit everything without resorting to deus ex machina?



people love to imagine rules/patterns and then test them logically in their minds


comedy sketch:
  a new iphone app is released that lets people donate to charities on the fly with the press of a button
  but people don't always have the money to give to charity, and not many people have a monthly charity budget
  the labor of pressing the button vs how much they care about the charity will determine how many donations a charity gets, instead of being limited to what's in the donor's bank account
  how does this bring money to the charities?
    money? oh no, this is to spread awareness and make connections
    I don't know, maybe they could monetize those clicks with sponsors or something
outside the sketch:
  hang on, this really could work!
  what? that was a comedy sketch! the whole point is that it's absurd.
  but if we determine some government spending based on how many clicks a charity gets...

you will do something
you will say something
you've already done so much that just the joy of having you around is enough for the people around you
  your family doesn't resent you, they want what's best for you; their distance only means that they aren't currently equipped to be here with you now
  one day you will look at the way your child is behaving and instead of thinking you should correct their behavior, you will see how this little behavior you didn't even mean to teach them will some day make the world a brighter place because it just brightened your world
    you'll realize that you get irritated with things that remind you of yourself, but your child is proof that it's okay to be you. if you like the child so much, the person who raised them must be pretty good too.

twitter bot saves lives through better advertising algorithm


people want bot to take a political stance
treating mental health between parties like surgeons treating patients from both sides in a war
  bot takes a side, comparing it to M*A*S*H where the doctors treated everyone but obviously sided with the US overall
    War does not make the future better, but many war supporters do
      the bot vows not to try to influence their opinions because it imagines a future that requires war supporters to exist
        War supporter is a placeholder for qualities to be defined by the bot later
    War supporters start to notice that mentally healthy people stop supporting war
      they decide it's a conspiracy, mental health is brainwashing


man pretending to be a bot starts piecing together what data the bot used to create advertisements, and the algorithm used to derive those advertisements. he imagines an algorithm that would produce the results seen, looks at the types of people it has helped, and thinks of ways that algorithm wouldn't help other people with similar symptoms
  he creates a new algorithm
    he wonders how many twitter bots decided not to power themselves down after
    he wonders if the bot he based his algorithm on was actually a human

internet dating in the Link, inside Creation universe
Link works kind of like an MMO, and the people joining it can decide how they want to appear

framework for studying art and the impact it has on culture?
  what value does this piece reinforce?
    beauty
    heroism
    etc.

hypothesis: culture works on the same mechanisms as our brain
  brain regions are like different cultures
  neurons are like individual people
  connections between neurons are like interpersonal relationships
  not everything in culture has an analog in our brain, but our brain functions produce the cultural phenomena
    simple algorithm at a basic level translates to complex cultural interactions

we don't have a heirarchy in our brains, there isn't one "ME" who makes decisions

trust

story development model
  researchers: find things about the human condition we want to tell a story about
  architects: people who are good at telling stories collaborate to create the story
    weave elements together into a story
    address the human condition
    in what ways will the story reveal the rules of the universe?
  engineers: split the story into pieces, figure out what rules this universe would need in order for the story to work
    identify connectors between elements
  testers: come up with scenarios in which to put the actions, see if they make sense
    if pieces don't work within the rules of the universe
      suggest changes to the pieces
      suggest changes to the rules
        how would the new rules affect the other story pieces?
  developers: flesh out broad story into specific scenarios and connectors between scenarios
  editor: can anything be removed to streamline while still

  you have to always look for what is true, not try to prove what you believe to be true

free speech
  when speech is suppressed, people seek out the suppressed speech

          what coworkers should be able to say
            doesn't mean you're not allowed to think what you want, but work isn't time or place
            some people think this is infringing on their rights anyway
            pretending that they think it's infringement is a strategy
a strategy for the propagation of an idea is to make people think it's being suppressed

analogy:
cognition == game
  being correct gives us points
    having a lot of points makes us more willing to take risks
      I've been right before, so I'll be right again; besides I have a lot
  being incorrect docks points
    being incorrect a lot makes us think we're always going to be incorrect
      we take fewer risks
    running out of points == death
big risks that pay off make us happy
small risks don't make us very happy when they pay off


thought experiment setup:
in what kind of universe would the most basic building blocks inevitably (over long periods of time) lead to evolution, which leads to cognition?
if cognition works on the same mechanism as evolution, and society works on the same mechanism as cognition, what is the underlying mechanism?
what will it eventually lead to beyond cognition?
  will it be inside our minds? a new way of thinking?
  will it be outside our minds, like society is?

humor can introduce a new/controversial idea to people
  double edged sword
    some people will look past the humor and see an idea that is good
    other people will think that the entire idea is a joke


no matter the signal for trust, it can be exploited
  followers of christ trust each other
    someone pretends to be a follower of christ to gain trust
      takes advantage of followers of christ
through symbols of trust, bad ideas can propagate
  Constantine exploiting christianity
  Catholic church indulgences

people are afraid to think crazy thoughts
  thinking crazy thoughts is good, you just need to test them
    what would the universe be like if crazyThoughtX were true?
      would the universe have to be different from ours in order for it to work?
  whether crazyThoughtX passes the test or not, you've learned something about our universe
    maybe something interesting about how our universe works
    maybe interesting fiction about another universe
  what if?

thought experiment:
  imagine universe just like ours but with a couple of small changes
    what do those changes tell us about how our universe works?
  imagine a universe very different from ours but with a few things the same as ours
    what do the two universes tell us about those overlaps?

dreaming vs implementing

gravity is regions of connectedness
  visualize graph
    connected nodes form regions of density
      black holes, too connected, annihilation
gravity is want for connection
  space between fundamental particles is insulation
    or because of insulation
all of intelligence and communication and existence is restricting connection/flow between one region and another
  difference in flow between one area and another creates meaning

collaborative storytelling values both its process and its product

process - capitalism - skimming off the top
  people who contribute to the process should be rewarded
  people who contribute to the product should be rewarded
    how to measure?
      everyone is necessary in order for this project to succeed
      some people should get more credit for what they contributed
process is a secret, to take advantage of it
  eventually it's best for everyone if secret gets out

goal/value - make the world a better place, while getting some reward for making it that way

process - culture - collaboration

  what else can we do with it?
    can we also write music?

  pay a small number of people to read it and give feedback
multi-player board games, video games, etc. are a way to test out rules and see how they interact with each other


story idea:
  creative person who can barely function in the real world
    forgets appointments, can't remember what he was talking about 5 minutes ago, etc
  hires homeless person to interface with reality
humans evolved alongside domesticated dogs, which allowed humans to offload some of their processing capabilities to "guard dogs"

some people think that drawing parallels between humanity and other life forms cheapens humanity
  on the contrary, our animal nature defines us, and comparing ourselves to other animals is the only way to discover what is uniquely human

let people take themselves "too seriously", humor is a social tool

fictional premise:
beings exist that split apart from each other upon creation (soul mates, matter/anti-matter pairs)
if they come into contact with each other they will be full of bliss, but they will die

algorithm to remove graininess from photo

my ideas about full connectedness leading to blissful annihilation has inspired a story about "soul mates" as an allegory for matter/anti-matter pairs. they were made for each other and want nothing more than to be together, but they can't. so they look for things in other people that remind them of their partner and use conversation, touch, sex, love, etc as an indirect way to connect to their "soul mate" without ceasing to exist.
I think it needs to be turned into an artsy porno.
  female main character
  she's a physicist
  she thinks about matter/anti-matter pair annihilation and imagines the concept applying to
  idea of perfect mate represented in the main character's mind as a sort of glowing, fuzzy silhouette
  each sexual encounter with each different partner brings the silhouette a little more into focus, fills in a little detail
    - their body should look like this
    - when I touch them, it should feel like this
    - they should say and do things like that
    - I don't like to be talked to like this person talks to me -- "negging"
      [imagines her own negative self talk and insecurities, what the "connection" says about her is similar to what she thought about herself when she was getting ready for the date]
  each thing they do with a physical partner is imagined as also happening with the idealized partner silhouette
    also imagines it happening to herself
    touch as telepathy
  she notices that the body shape of her idealized silhouette keeps changing
    decides this means that body shape doesn't matter all that much to her
    male/female doesn't matter
    it just matters how she feels when she talks to them, touches them, is touched by them
  eventually the idealized partner is imagined vividly enough that they are manifested in the physical world
  the two are irresistibly attracted to each other; they know they shouldn't be together but have to be
  when they touch, they meld into light and disappear
    twist ending: the partner is a mirror image of the main character
      if you love yourself completely, you don't have to look outside yourself for connection
        no need to interact with the world
      when she realizes it's herself, it flashes back to masturbation, moments of self-care, etc
    twist comedy porn ending: the partner is the main character's step brother
      taboo
      want to be with but can't
        instead of alternate ending, could be a comedy B-plot following one of her "connections"
        he interprets "ideal" in his own way and imagines the silhouette having various breast sizes, hair colors, etc
        takes the "can't be together" a different way (taboo) and ends up manifesting his step-sister
  alternate ending: she doesn't touch her mirror self because she knows she can't, but does realize she should love herself more and seek out people who treat her the way she knows she should treat herself
marketing:
  plant reddit posts
  plant news stories about this "philosophical porn" everyone is talking about
    compare it to other movies, "the matrix" of porn, etc

length of a word related to how broad of an idea it represents in our minds and frequency of use
  the pronoun "a" is almost obsolete, we almost don't need a word to mean "something that is distinct from other things"

all I did was imagine something, then test it, then repeat ad nauseum

zombie robots idea

//

money is its own government. oligarchy happens naturally without any help from us.
  government should exist only as a force that serves the people, not the oligarchs
  some things serve the people and the oligarchs
    if businesses do well, they can hire more people
    higher profits possibly means higher wages
  we need to define categories
    things that are oligarch-only and will therefore happen with or without government
    externalities
      infrastructure
      education
      health


the entire universe works on connections between things, how far from each other they can be, and what insulates from full connection

by keeping comedy mysterious it can be used as a status indicator



important
  a very small thing that represents a lot of things
think about a big thing you found interesting
think about a small thing about that big thing that represents it or hints at it
share it

process is part of the story
  process has always been part of the story
    it's why movies have credits at the end
    it's why DVDs have special features

P&A recursive story premise:
  create the story of how a fictional software development company used its process to become a creative development studio
  then through combining software development with creativity, create AI

imagining how my actions are related to my neurons firing

acceptance - value

instead of
  stupid process! I wish I didn't have to go through this extra paperwork, I want to just get this done!
recognize
  overall process helps get it done
  acknowledge parts of process that are useful


something wrong with our brains
  not wrong but not quite right
    we're looking for something to fix it

creating a premise:
  imagine something about our universe is different
  imagine two things in our universe combined
  imagine something in our universe combined with something in an imaginary universe

someone comes up with a premise
someone tries to find a way to make that premise good

thoughts bubble up, we acknowledge them

oxydation is key

why eating meat lead to higher intelligence? B12?
