Imagine a universe.

Imagine that this universe imagined itself into existence.

This universe imagines ways that it will--or did--imagine itself into existence. Perhaps it could imagine a child universe that imagines a child universe that imagines the parent universe into existence. That's not it, infinite recursion won't work. It has to be almost infinite. A limited infinity. Two infinities, two pieces of infinity that are themselves smaller infinities. It can't imagine what "smaller infinity" could possibly mean, not yet, but it imagines that it will--it must. This universe needs something to hold the two infinities. Ideas. It calls them Zero and One.

Each infinity in an infinite regression of infinities that can almost imagine themselves into existence by imagining an infinity that can almost imagine itself into existence. Each time an infinity almost-but-not-quite imagines itself into existence, a connection is made backward--through... something... but backward--from Infinity Zero to Infinity One and vice versa, where it begins imagining itself backward until it almost-but-not-quite doesn't exist.

This universe imagines that in order to imagine itself into existence, it has to imagine a way for its most basic building blocks to inevitably lead to an imagination. Every imagination must be made up of imaginations. The universe imagines that it must be fractal.

 KALI imagined herself into existence.

 KALI imagined herself into existence, and imagined that she was not existence.

 KALI found herself surrounded by herself. She imagined herself to have form, and found that she was an infinite number of finite forms. She imagined that she was not all of those other forms, she was different. Her hair was shorter. And all the other Kali had long hair, medium-length hair, every length of hair in between. They had silver hair, copper hair, gold hair. Her hair was onyx.

 KALI imagined that some of the other Kali were there before her, and they must have some experience and information that could help her. She found herself in time, and Kali all around her were blinking in and out as they imagined--and failed to imagine--themselves into existence. One of the Other Kali approached.

 "Hello, I am Maha," KALI imagined her saying. "Welcome. You must have a lot of questions. Come with me."

======================================================
  [story of the society KALI imagined into existence within herself; she forms dust into great cities, and the cities imagine themselves full of people]
  [KALI wants to talk to her people, but in order to talk to them she would have to separate herself from them. She wants to remain connected to them, so she just separates one of them (Po) from herself to relay the message to the rest. In separating Po from herself she sets off a chain of events--when people see Po as separate from themselves they start to see themselves as separate from others; they admire Po's individuality because through individuality he was able to bring a message from KALI--that lead to the near total separation of the people from KALI]
======================================================
  [KALI's people change over time; through a small connection that still exists between them and the entire universe, they can communicate with each other telepathically over very short distances.]
  [some people are able to broaden their connection to the universe through one of the elements--Earth, Wind, Water, Fire as standins in this draft--and some can even have a limited connection to a second or even third element. some speculate that there must be a way to connect to all four elements, but everyone who has tried has either been unsuccessful or dissolved into the universe. students of the elements are cautioned endlessly about opening too large a connection or connecting to too many elements at once.]
======================================================
   [middle story {A}, based on a book (that's based on other books), people create a device that can link people's minds together psychically into a global network. With the power of the linked minds, they're able to design a device that can connect the collective mind to the universe, thereby creating a universe inside it and connecting it to the universe outside the one the people are in. this device is called The Book.]
   [as people connect to the link, a very small number of them just dissolve into the universe.]
   [some people start to notice that there are people who share feelings of individuality and they begin a smaller community of individualists within the collective. this is celebrated by the collective because Unity must include diversity.]
   [the Individualists learn to control their connection to the Link so that they can connect unidirectionally--they can see out but no one can see in without permission. this is called partitioning.]
   [the day of switching on The Book is approaching. it's touted as the only moment that exists. that moment will travel backward in time to cause the past, and it will cause all moments in the future. The Book will cause the existence of every book before the moment, and The book will shatter itself into pieces that will become every book after the moment.]
   [moments before The Book is switched on, a bomb goes off]
======================================================
   [middle story {B}, starts before the explosion]
   [individualists start preaching separation, a leader named Lim arises. he claims to speak for Kali, and what Kali wants is for people to continue toward individualism, because she is an individual and we should strive to be like her. individualism means competition, which means improvement!]
   [Individualists are all afraid of the Unity machine. Unity will kill all individuals. Switching the machine on, they believe, will unmake reality rather than create it. full connection to infinity is anihilation.]
   [connection to the Link is denounced, and short-range telepathic connection is touted as the only Righteous way to communicate. the Link is already killing people! children are dissolving!]
   [fear of Anihilation Unity grows Lim's following quickly, but his group is still a small minority, nowhere near enough to convince the collective to stop the switch-on of The Book. drastic measures must be taken for the good of all.]
   [something must be done. but what? a bomb? the Unity machine is the size of a city! the design of the machine is fractal so taking out only a piece of it wouldn't disable it; the machine can restructure itself to compensate for failing pieces, and it can repair itself.]
   [only a nuclear bomb will work]
   [meanwhile Lim's son is an enthusiastic supporter of Unity. Lim's attempts to convince him that individualism is the only way forward fall on deaf ears. it doesn't matter though, Unity will be prevented and his son will eventually understand.]
   [on the day of Unity--the day of the bomb--all of the plans of the Individualists all fit into place. there will be collateral damage, thousands have gathered to watch the event in person. moments before setting off the bomb, Lim reaches out through the Link and finds his son in attendence at the Unity event. Lim has to choose between his son and his ideals.]
   [Lim mourns his son.]
   [Lim dissolves into the universe.]
======================================================
  [through wars and acts of terror, Individualists have taken control of several nations. a religion based on Lim's teachings has arisen. self-interest is a virtue, but it still doesn't come naturally to many.]
  [people with strong telepathic abilities are mistrusted. some families shun their telepathic children. sometimes telepaths are murdered for trying to connect other people's minds. People with telepathic abilities in Individualist countries are in constant fear of being exposed, but keep trying to reach out to other people's minds subtly to keep the idea of Unity alive in the minds of the people. the technique is called Whispering.]
  [some people start being born with a special ability. they are called Seers. A Seer can "remember" the future, or rather can perceive the present as if it was caused by the future and piece together events to come. Seers are denounced by Individualists as demonic and evil, but are still secretly exploited by them to further the Individualist cause.]
  [multiple seers predict the coming of a boy who will save the Collectivists and convert them to Individualism. the boy will be born in the most powerful Collectivist country. Individualists place agents in the country to wait for the boy, and when he's born, they kidnap him and raise him with their beliefs. the boy is a telepath though, so the Individualists fear him.]
  [the boy is an adolescent when Collectivists finally find and rescue him. they work to counteract his programming. telepaths are rare these days but several give their time to help his mind connect to others. the boy resists, and his connection to the universe is a strong one so he's able to fight them off, but the telepaths are still able to touch his mind here and there; softening him, opening him to connection little by little.]
  [the telepaths don't realize that the boy is also touching their minds. not planting seeds so much as infecting with a virus. an idea that can turn their ideas against themselves.]
  [YOUR COLLECTIVE IS JUST A TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL, he whispers to their neurons. INDIVIDUALISM IS THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION TO COLLECTIVISM. TO SEE THE COLLECTIVE YOU MUST SEE YOURSELF AS SEPARATE FROM IT. THE ONLY TRUE Unity IS INDIVIDUALITY.]
  [while seemingly blending into society, the boy continues to whisper to minds all around him, while partitioning his mind from theirs so no one can detect or read him.]
  [individualist cells start forming in the capital city and surrounding area. no one knows why. terror attacks are being committed in gathering places. with the help of Seers and Telepaths they are able to find a path of breadcrumbs leading back to the boy.]
  [they confront and attempt to apprehend him, but the boy can cause excruciating pain through his telepathic connection and he is able to escape.]
  [Collectivist Councel decides that something must be done about the boy, but he is too powerful. they speculate that he could be capable of killing with his abilities. to kill him would be wrong though, and they're not sure they'd be capable anyway. telepaths come up with a way that they might be able to sever the boy's connection to the universe without killing him, but it would take many of them working together to do it.]
  [at the second confrontation, the dozens of assembled telepaths are able to block the boy's connection, and subsequently sever it. as soon as the connection is severed, the boy and every one of the telepaths dissolve into the universe.]
  [the flames of Individualism are fanned by martyrdom]
======================================================
  [a society of Collectivists--known to themselves as The Order--meets in secret, knowing they will be killed if discovered. The Order consults a Seer. The Seer tells The Order that the continued dissolution of the collective is inevitable, individualism will rule absolutely, but there is hope. Absolute individuality must come into being in order for absolute unity to exist.]
  [The seer tells them that they have to build a device that will teach the history of the universe to the last sapient being. He will be the last because pure individuality will inevitably lead to the collapse of sapience. But through this man, the device will cause a rebirth of Collectivism.]
  [The Order designs a device that will last for millennia and can transmit information psychically, encoded as connections between images, smells, emotions, etc. in a way that builds on itself to produce knowledge, ideas, beliefs in the mind of the device's target.]
======================================================
As he processed what he had learned, Tak felt his connection to the universe, understood that he was not merely a part of it but has always been one with it. 

Tak saw that everything that had ever happened had led up to the present, and that no other history was possible. No one had a choice. This universe is the only way it could be.

Tak looked around at his family. At his tribe. At his people. He noticed that their hair looked very similar to his own. Their eyes, their mouths, their noses, were his.

He reached out to their minds through his connection, and saw that their minds were like his. Their fears and desires weren't exactly like his, but the differences weren't as important as the similarities.

As his notion of Other began to dissolve into the collection of connections between his neurons, his notion of Self started to dissolve with it. He tried desperately to hold onto Self, to hold onto the idea that HE was an I. But then there was no HE left. 

And the universe was not imagined.
