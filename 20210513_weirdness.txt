terminology: code complete


network AI = NODE0
have model of the way NODE1 behaves
have model of the way NODE2 behaves
have model of the way NODE3 behaves
NODE2 makes request to NODE3
NODE3 hands off information about the request to NODE0
NODE3 handles request, returns data to NODE2
NODE2 makes another request to NODE3
NODE3 hands off information about the request to NODE0
NODE0 responds that the request should be denied because NODE2 is not behaving in a manner consistent with our model of NODE2
	unless: NODE2 reports that it's acting on behalf of NODE1	
		and: this behavior is consistent with our model of how NODE1 would behave when acting through NODE2
----------------
counter security
another AI surveils the network, learning patterns of behavior of entities
hypothesizes how NODE1 would behave if acting through NODE2
	NODE1 sends a request to NODE2, encrypted with NODE1's public key it uses only for NODE2
		inside the data of the request is a piece that's encrypted with NODE1's public key it uses only for NODE3
			NODE3 decrypts the data
			checks its contents against NODE0's model of NODE1
			adds this transaction to the hash associated with NODE1
			sends packet back to NODE1 encrypted with its key that's only for NODE1, contents being the new hash that NODE3 associates with NODE1
			this is what NODE1 will send NODE3-encrypted to the request to NODE2 next time
				NODE3 keeps list of a few recent hash signatures, will accept requests signed with any of these
					suspicion of deviation from behavioral model increases with the age of the hash signature
