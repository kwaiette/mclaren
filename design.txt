Accessibility goes hand-in-hand with automation and AI. We'd all benefit if people spent more time thinking, "how would people who are not like me use this?"

Example: I get so DAMNED frustrated and feel stupid when a page (or app) loads on my phone, I go to tap something, and JUST before my fingerpad hits the screen, *fwoosh* it's gone and I just clicked the button to delete all saved files. Sure, it has a confirmation dialog, "Are you sure you want to do something this stupid?" Yeah I know, I'm a geezer who doesn't know how to use this new technology. Could you please fix this garbage? When I accidentally tap an ad because of this, the app gets uninstalled toute suit! That's actually tout suite, I just googled it. See? I know I'm not perfect.

I think it should be illegal for real estate agents to get commissions that are dependent on the sale price of the house. 



How to become an artist:

Step 1. Have something to say. Something outside of what's popular. Something that your buddy wouldn't just pause from sipping his Bud Light and say, "Fuckin' A, man!"

Step 2. Find a medium that you feel like you can express yourself through.

Step 3. Try to ignore the people who tell you that you don't have anything worth saying.

Step 4. Keep trying. HOLY FUCK, KEEP TRYING!
