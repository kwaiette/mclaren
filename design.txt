Accessibility goes hand-in-hand with automation and AI. We'd all benefit if people spent more time thinking, "how would people who are not like me use this?"

Example: I get so DAMNED frustrated and feel stupid when a page (or app) loads on my phone, I go to tap something, and JUST before my fingerpad hits the screen, *fwoosh* it's gone and I just clicked the button to delete all saved files. Sure, it has a confirmation dialog, "Are you sure you want to do something this stupid?" Yeah I know, I'm a geezer who doesn't know how to use this new technology. Could you please fix this garbage? When I accidentally tap an ad because of this, the app gets uninstalled toute suit!
