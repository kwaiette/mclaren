process: envision what I want

what I envision
	CI/CD/CT/CDep/CDoc
		pattern: human connector
		process: semantic versioning through build promotion
	microservice architecture
		operations (mux, demux, forward, transform, store, send/receive, call/answer)
	

	request ID, auditing
		pattern: legacy node, 

	feedback
		observe, hypothesize / predict, test

CDoc
	dependencies as documentation
	pseudocode as documentation


sequence

have an idea -> tell person -> create jira ticket

god of the gaps

documentation-to-code pipeline
test-and-observe strategy


environment: bottom-up definition as well as top-down definition


modeling : implementing

philosophy: don't let perfect be the enemy of good
	tag things that match or don't match values
	keep values in mind as we implement, but don't stop because we don't know how to fit a specific thing into a value
		vendor-specific queries for a DB

describe > proceed


configuration
	//


blue/green human gap


concept
	enforcement?

it IS separate and it CAN'T be separate
	this means...
