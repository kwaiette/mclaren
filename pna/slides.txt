animals are psychic
  - where is the water?
  - where are the predators?
  - if you can predict the future (water will be there when I get there) you have a better chance at survival
  - if you're wrong, you expended energy with no reward

humans got better at predicting the future
  - it hasn't rained in several days, so that one pool will be dried up; we need to go in the opposite direction
  - predicting the future in a sophisticated way increases survival and reduces risk

predict the future by creating the future
  - irrigation
    * don't need to know where the water is, we put it in pipes!
  - weapons
    * predators? psh! we got this.

story telling
  - stack up enough pieces so we can stand on top of it and see the big picture

stereoscopic vision
  - easy for the brain to see small differences between two slightly different images side-by-side / overlapping
  - principle can be applied to things other than vision
    * take

agile process as collaborative story writing process
  - P&A culture
    * creator / refiner / advancer / executor
	* fantasy
  - looking at agile software dev and agile writing stereoscopically
    * where do they overlap?
	* what's different about them?
	* how does this knowledge help us understand both agile process and software dev?

what would agile process look like applied to writing?
  - ideas start out as cards, like Trello
    * premise
	* plot points
	* settings
  --cards are refined
    * physical and personality attributes of characters
  --cards are advanced
    * create new cards representing events that advance the plot or the character development
  --cards are implemented
    * the actual writing, in a format people would want to read
  - testing
    * P&A culture
	  + psychology: "I don't think this character would do this, based on their personality type and what we know about humans"
	    - should we change the character to match
	    - does the character need to be non-human to explain the personality difference? if so, what's different about that species that makes them behave differently? physical, cultural, etc?
	  + physics: "This couldn't happen this way with the physics of our universe"
	    - change physics of fictional universe?
		- change event in fictional universe to match physics?
	  + board gaming: checking interactions between rules in universe
	    - note: in development, we don't need to / shouldn't define rules until we need to in order to develop the story

P&A "side quest"
  - optional story collaboration
  - goals:
    * write an entertaining story
    * learn about process
	* apply what we learn to software dev
	* possibly:
	  + create new tool for collaborative development
	  + make $$ off of story
	  + revolutionize fiction and/or software development

what tools might help this process?
  - process and development integration
  - cards (objects) and connections
    * refine, implement, etc

coupling process with development helps both
  - process can also feed back into process development
    * [refine] process connectors/cards

how does this relate to software development?
  - a piece of software as a fictional universe
    * has its own rules
	* has:
	  + characters (objects)
	  + settings (architecture), plots (data getting from )
  - ABT: Always Be Testing
