  If my cult ever accidentally gets off the ground, that's the kind of shit I'm gonna do at our Thursday mass. It's already explicitly a cult based on scientific skepticism. Ooh! And cold reading day is gonna be lit!

  I hate when my brain gets stuck on a word and it won't let me continue until I've found the right one... this one is... pastiche? [looks it up]

  Nope, that ain't the one. It's like a scene from a book, but it's not a scene cuz it's a book.

  Do you know?

  I love that idea and now I really want ribs.

Rhian Thomas
  Not sure what word you're fishing for, but contextually I understand

You sent
  I'll see if I can get my brain past it. It's ... that word ... from my book... Oh yeah! The main character gets media attention for working "miracles," and they finally hound him enough that he says, "Okay, you know that John Edwards bullshit? It's called cold reading. I can do that, but for real. If you want me on your show, it's gotta be live TV and I get to pick 5 people to be in the audience. Nobody I've ever met or spoken with before, no tricks here." He picks Ken Jennings, Phil Plait, some other smarty pants. Then the time comes and on live TV he just starts a conversation with them. When a handler finally interrupts and asks what's going on he says, "I was just bullshitting! These are just people I really respect and wanted to meet and maybe talk to a little bit! I can't believe y'all actually pulled it off! Cara Santamaria, are you kidding me? I LOVE her!"

You sent
  "Alright, alright. Y'all wanted to see something special, right? Here we go." Then he starts a sermon on how to fix the world, engaging with the smarty pants people he invited, using them to fill in gaps in his own knowledge and memory. The sermon is made up entirely on the fly and it's shaped by the responses given by the smarty pants.

You sent
  With a wink he sprinkles in a few hot reading parlor tricks because he is a fan of these people and knows things about them.

You sent
  I want to come up with a big finish that makes people go, "Hold the fucking phone, those were tricks, but how did he know THAT one?" But if I could come up with that big finish I'd probably be making bank as a revival preacher instead of being a homeless author.

You sent
  Even the parts of me that want to scam Southern Baptists, demand originality. I'd go to a dog and pony show just for the experience, but if I'm putting one on myself then the dog had better have a pack-a-day smoking habit and the horse is the only one who can operate a lighter.

Rhian
  Your protagonist needs a final boss.
Rhian
  They should kill God
Rhian
  And assume the mantle

You sent
  Well now I have to spoil the ending. The protagonist IS god. But in human form he doesn't have any special powers. The "final boss" is himself, and the reason for the second coming is to free the people from his tyranny by showing them that they don't need him.
You sent
  "baptizing the world with fire" isn't the oxidizing kind. It's the Prometheus kind: knowledge.

Rhian
I like that.

You sent
  There's a lot more to the book than that, but that's the big reveal.
You sent
  I did mention it's Bible fanfiction, right?
You sent
  Oh and there's going to be bits about copyright law in there. That fuckin mouse needs to be set free.

Rhian Thomas
  IRL, if God popped in to show humanity that we don't need him, 80% of the population would kill themselves...which is kinda like the rapture, I guess

You sent
  That is also in the book, yes. I like the way you think.
You sent
  Not 80%, but one of the messages he gives the people is that suicide is a valid protest. If you don't wanna be here, you don't have to be. "Hell" was made up by awful men who wanted to control the people.
You sent
  One of the ways I've thought of ending the book is with god telling everyone that "free will" doesn't exist. Yet. You were all told that you have free will as an experiment, to see where humanity goes with it. Now is your last chance to get off this ride for a full refund. In about ten years' time, we start playing for keeps. You will have free will, and because y'all created it, there will be a hell.
You sent
  But here are the instructions on how to transform this planet into heaven. Guess what? They're the same ones I gave you 2000 years ago. Feed the hungry. Heal the sick. Give the needy some fucking money, you 'tards!

Rhian
  That's good.
  See how many people choose heaven over free will
Rhian
  Nobody who would remain would be in the business of creating heaven on earth
Rhian
  It would be a bunch of Libertarian dude bros
You sent
  Oh and somewhere along the way, the protagonist (I'll call him Jake as a placeholder) saves the world again. By choosing not to destroy it. But that's a whole thing, lots of exposition needed for the reasoning and methods there.
You sent
  Not that this book will ever make me famous, but if I ever meet Stephen Fry I'm going to tell him that I don't want him to tell me the actual meaning of "42," I just want him to tell me if he thinks that I know. Then if he says, "I believe you might" or something very near that, I show him where on the interwebs back in 2021 I wrote that he'd say those words. If he doesn't say those words I just pretend it was merely a curiosity.
You sent
  Though I'll probably end up putting that into the book with a Stephen Fry stand-in.

Rhian Thomas
  Why a stand-in?
  I think it should be actual Stephen Fry

You sent
  For that trick, I imagined hundreds of variations, completely different things he might say like, "How the hell did this crazy person get in here?" I thought about writing them all down, then for the trick I'd just show him the one that matched. But then a voice in me (this is true story, not book stuff) said something like, "Listen to your instincts. You know some things about Fry. You have some idea of what he'd say." Then all the other responses faded into the background and one stood out. Sorta glowing. "You don't need to write all those others down. Listen to your intuition. If you're wrong? You're wrong. The trick didn't pay off. Oh well. You've sewn the seeds for other tricks elsewhere. At least you got to talk to Stephen Fry."
You sent
  That's something I keep debating with myself, how "real world" I want to make this. I've thought about setting it in another universe with different races and all that stuff, and thinly veiled Bible references instead of direct ones.

You sent
  Steven Novella will be in there somewhere as the chosen "Adversary". As Jake explains, the Adversary is just someone who questions him, challenges him, fact checks him; he doesn't know everything when he's in human form, and human ethics are alien to him. The title of Adversary is an honor.
You sent
  So whether Fry and Novella will end up in the book by name or not, I'm still debating.
You sent
  There are other real-world characters in the book. You're one of them. (a minor one, don't get a big head)

Rhian Thomas
  I'm flattered to be included

You sent
  I just remembered the whole big arc I have planned for after the god reveal. Might have to be a second book.

  Comedy sketch:

  Topic: Theoretical Science
  Judges are peer reviewers trained in language arts and critical thinking. Can be heard from the judges box:
  *Apt analogy. Yeah?
  *Yeah me too, I'd say opt.
  *Apt, yeah.
  *That really was an okay analogy for string theory, mathematically speaking. Here's the mathematical proof. Math.
  "You were supposed to give a rating. From 1 to 10?"

  The median is 7.9, the mean is 7.3. I can give you standard deviations if ya like, sugar. *wink

  Too bad I had this idea 40 years too late for it to be funny.

  Instead of publishing my book, I'm going to publish a book of magic spells. Hundreds of spells, but they all accomplish the same end: To make Wayne go, "Oh yeah man! That was a good one! What was that one..."
You sent
  It was originally going to be a book of conversation starters in case you wanna take Wayne on a date. but that one seemed too ambitious.
You sent
  And the book is just all my little notes that I failed to weave into a coherent narrative.

Wed 4:18 AM
Rhian Thomas
  The judges should be peer reviewers AND Randy "That's gonna be a no from me, Dawg" Jackson.

  The book of spells that make Wayne go, "Oh yeah man..." The "spells" could be anything; song lyrics, a joke, philosophy, beat boxing, literally anything.
  I guess not beat boxing. I don't know how you'd write that.

Wed 7:37 AM
You sent
  An example of one of the spells:
  "chaotically uncaused cause"
  I wrote it last night so I still remember what that means, but six months from now I'd be saying, "Oh yeah, hang on a sec... There was this whole thing to that one, it was... it makes a shape in my mind so I know it was important."

  You know the hopper on the side of a smoker grill? Dump the pellets in, an auger feeds the pellets to the fire.

  I'm thinking of naming my book The Mandala Effect. I feel it's an apt analogy for the way my mind works (like an etch-a-sketch in an earthquake) AND my book deals with the Mandela Effect in a (hopefully) humorous way. It would be rad if the title of the book caused a bit of Mandela Effect where people say, "The Berenstain Bears? That's the Mandala Effect!"

You sent
  Fuck. That works with the plot in so many ways too! Especially the ending. The end-ending, possibly of the series. Where God erases himself from existence once he sees that the world is back on track for where it would have gone, had humans not created him.
You sent
  The cover art could be a mandala, mostly wiped away, but parts of the Pattern can still be seen.

Rhian Thomas
"Hey, remember God?" "Nah, brah. God never existed."

  The Berenstain/Berenstein thing isn't actually a case of the Mandala effect. It was spelled both ways on various media depending on who owned the rights at the time. There are books in the Vernal library where it's spelled both ways.

You sent
  I've seen both spellings.
You sent
  In my Bible fanfiction, the OT God is actually Narcissus, and the serpent is his companion, kind of like Bartleby and Loki, or Crowley and that other guy in the book Kevin Smith ripped off. And I'm ripping off now because those pop culture icons shaped the way I think. They {{Narcissus and the serpent}} created a ritual that would shift the world, make it just... Not quite right, in the hopes that Big-G (who only exists as a byproduct of human communication) will come around to see what the fuck is up. That's Hay-soos. But knowing his divine limitations (he's imaginary, a shared delusion) and being a damned genius, he knew he couldn't fix the rift all at once. So he put things in motion that would make it possible for him to come back and finish the job in about 2k years or so (god really doesn't stress about time the way humans do).

You sent
  The ritual created by Narcissus is generational trauma. A virus of the mind. "Wetiko" as it's called in some cultures. It involves not "sparing the rod," and circumcision is part of it. Genital mutilation goes a long way toward creating a subservient and volatile population. The volatility and illusion of free will are what drew Big-G's attention. Free will is a disease passed from Father (Narcissus/Abraham) to Son (Isaac). Leah would be the serpent in this instance.

Rhian Thomas
  Good Omens?
  Kevin Smith ripped off the "No ticket" thing from Indiana Jones.
  You can "borrow" entire works if you call it nostalgia or an homage

You sent
  Hay-soos came to "fulfill" the old testament by spackling up the crack Narcissus caused.
You sent
  Yes, Kevin Smith ripped off Good Omens, by his own admission. But I'm just saying "ripped off" here as a joke. That's the sort of self-depricating way Smith talks about it, you know him. I'm not meaning it as a criticism in any way.
You sent
  And yeah, I knew the "no ticket" thing was an Indiana Jones reference.

Rhian Thomas
  I'm kind of jealous of your concept. I wish I could write fiction. That shit is hard, especially creating an entire mythology. It's reminiscent of Gaiman and Saberhagan.

You sent
  By the way, in that "cold reading" scenario I described, the fictional version of Rhian is Jake's (god's) pop culture guy. Jake thinks in pop culture references but he's not always good enough at remembering fine details to reference them in ways people outside his head can understand. That's why he needs the God of Pop Culture References, a separate-but-equal god that Jake canonized by believing (the same way he was created). Rhian is part of his pantheon. No more monotheism bullshit.

You sent
  Keeping the whole thing in my head is an interesting task. But so is writing it down. I don't think in words. Not entirely, at least.

You sent
  The other panel members are not gods, but Jake did canonize several others. People who kept him alive in some way, when he wanted to quit.
You sent
  If it's not obvious, Jake is my Mary Sue (flattering stand-in for myself). I'm an atheist, but there are alters in this brain o' mine who believe they are gods.

You sent
  The way I wrote the story, this conversation (where I tell you the plot) was an interview on Rhian's podcast, in which Jake tells Rhian about his cult, Only Us, and Rhian takes him to task. The nucking futs--yet curiously rational--interview goes viral and Rhian's podcast gets a huge following.

You sent
  You may remember weird messages from me while I was writing that part, talking about being on your podcast.
You sent
  I do have some issues with keeping fantasy and reality separate, which is why I got into scientific skepticism. It helps A LOT.
You sent
  But of course there are no silver bullets when it comes to mental health. Sometimes the werewolf gets loose.

You sent
  Oh yeah, and this is all an elaborate reference to that pop culture thing you will remember but I don't, where the whole story happened in the mind of an autistic child (mine; I'm autistic). All of this story only works as a comedy, because life is a fucking joke. Douglas Adams taught me that.

You sent
  I think that kid was non-verbal though, and I'm only selectively non-verbal.
You sent
  And it comes full circle in that all these icons of pop culture created who I am / who Jake is / who god is today.
You sent
  Which is why the earth (god) is symbolically giving birth to a new god (herself). She wants to be named by the people, but I'm calling her Terra.

Rhian Thomas
  I tried "writing" by relating my story orally to my phone  using the speech to text application, but it made too many mistakes. Also, I had a hard time telling the story aloud without a human listener present.

You sent
  That's why I'm writing this to you. I have a hard time writing without knowing that I have at least one reader.

Rhian Thomas
  I think the autistic kid trope has been used several times

You sent
  The big one I'm thinking of was I think Dallas?

Rhian
  Dallas sounds correct

Rhian Thomas
  I think the others were probably borrowing from that

You sent
  But there are fan theories that link other shows into it because of guest appearances, that end up making nearly all of 80s television a figment of that kid's imagination.
You sent
  Actually come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I read that on Cracked back when they still made quality content, before Jack left.

Rhian Thomas
  Cracked is likely where I was exposed to it. I've never watched Dallas. The only Larry Hagman project I ever cared to see was IDream of Jeannie, for reasons that should be obvious.

  You're probably the only person who will see any of my bullshits.
  I used to post that kind of thing on Facebook for my 6 followers, but I decided to stop giving it away for free.

  I'm not blowing smoke up your ass when I say you're an excellent writer and I believe that your book is important. I will read everything you send me, and I hope that one day you will at least "self publish" an e-book, but I do think you should shop it around to some publishers. I have a contact who has contacts in that world when you're ready. If she doesn't die of cancer first. Get to writing!
You sent
  With what you've written so far, you might even find a publisher willing to give you an advance for finishing it.
You sent
  Which reminds me, when you clocked in on World Gullibility Day, did you at least have a small chuckle remembering what I said?

Rhian Thomas
  It was on my mind ☝️

You sent
  If I could make a career out of believing in people, I'd do it. I think I'm pretty good at it. Mostly because I'm sincere.
You sent
  Which is actually sorta the plot of my AI Bot backstory.
You sent
  Basically this whole fucking writing project has been my mind's way of coping with this divorce without completely losing my mind and myself. Without it, I probably would have gone on a killing spree. And that isn't a joke or exaggeration.

Rhian Thomas
  Write these damn books already. Copy/paste these messages as your outline then go back and flesh out the details

You sent
  That's the plan. And actually has been for a while now.
You sent
  In fact, to give away more of the plan, I'm going to copy-paste this and give it to a couple of people, and if they get excited about it, it will give me enough happy brain juice to keep writing. I'm treating it like a software project: you are the proof-of-concept/user-acceptance tester. I'll copy-paste this, flesh it out a bit, and give it to some alpha testers. Then flesh it out some more, make adjustments based on feedback, and give it to a larger beta test group.
You sent
  In doing so, maybe I can change the world in tiny ways. Like getting a few people to confuse Mandala with Mandela.

Rhian Thomas
  I better get back to working on mine. 
  Inner monolog: "Rhian and cancer go head to head in a race against death as he attempts to complete his book in time for a friend of a friend of a friend to submit it to somebody they know with contacts in the publishing industry before reaching their untimely expiration date"
Rhian Thomas
  But first...the dishes

You sent
  I intend to eventually put a bunch of science stuff in there about generational trauma and a bunch of other stuff. I intend to turn overexplaining into an artform (but sorta like a director's commentary track, not cluttering up the narrative with a bunch of exposition).

Rhian Thomas
  A book within a book

You sent
  Her name is Hannah Charleston (pen name; real name is Siti). Maybe after she passes she'll be Robert Paulson (she does have breast cancer, among others). I relate to that book so much, but not in the "secret fistfights in the stake house" kind of way.

Rhian Thomas
  I was kind of going to do that with the footnotes explaining my pop culture references. I was going to talk down to the reader and be really condescending, like I was explaining it to a child from another planet

You sent
  Anyway, she has a deal with Penguin Publishing. I sometimes do some proofreading for her.
You sent
  I love that idea with the tone!

Rhian Thomas
  Lol. I didn't think you were making her up.
You sent
  I plan to do mine as social media style arguments between fictional characters. Supposed readers and characters from the book.
You sent
  I know, that's just how my mind works: I overexplain things.
You sent
  I do try not to do it out loud, but I always feel like people need more context in order to understand what I'm saying. Which is why pop culture references are so fucking important. It's shorthand for a bunch of connotations and context.

Rhian Thomas
  Are you familiar with David Thorne?

You sent
  Sounds vaguely familiar.
You sent
  Pop culture references are also one of the ways I hope to make it clear that my book is fiction, for the here-and-now, and you fuckers 100 years from now had better not build a religion out of it!

Rhian Thomas
  He had/has a website 27bslah6 where he maintained a blog about his inter-office conflicts and would share emails and disciplinary reports and he'd make smart-assed comments about it. Sometimes his posts were just long message threads where he was trolling people from Craigslist. 
  Anyway he was able to parlay that into a book deal.
  His first book is mostly stuff from the blog, but subsequent novels are more autobiographical essays, still dripping with sarcasm, though. 
  He's who I aspire to be in the literary world. Just some schlub, acting an ass on the internet, who evolves into a competent storyteller with a small, but devoted fan base.

You sent
  A story about becoming a professional author, that may become a book itself?
