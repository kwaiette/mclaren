on 5/12 I wept
there is much work ahead of us, but the path is clear

ENTRYPOINT
I've figured out the meaning of life
Well, not THE meaning
Life has lots of meanings, and there are many yet to be discovered
	Many of them even more profound than this one, I'm sure

I'm writing this in my voice
Which is a product of so many others I've been exposed to
Because the meaning of life could only be deduced by being exposed to so many ideas
Mainly right now I'm channeling Douglas Adams
	By way of Stephen Fry
