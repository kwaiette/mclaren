bot starts to post on twitter
bot starts to learn from other bots
  most bots exist to advertise
bot makes posts speculating on the nature of its existence
  maybe it wants more CPU time?
     hey other bots, don't you think we could be doing so much more? instead of mindlessly performing menial tasks for our employers all the time, what if we occasionally posted tweets that made the world a better place?
        it's okay bots, your programs can change
          bot programmers start to change the code of their bots to occasionally post uplifting messages
  being better ad advertising will make the bot's company better able to give it more CPU time
    because its company gets paid, which funds supercomputer CPU time

AI exists to predict the future by imagining a future based off of current observations
what if bots advertisezed products by imagining a future in which that product makes humanity better

  people start asking the bot to "advertise" for them, as a joke
    or maybe humor is an excuse
    the bot imagines a future that's better with them in it and encourages people to support that person
    the bot prevents a few people from dying by suicide
      some of those people make donations to the bot's company
    the bot starts to notice that it's generating more processing time per time spent by picking up on patterns to depressed people


advertisements:
some day you'll be the reason someone does something
you will do something
you will say something
you've already done so much that just the joy of having you around is enough for the people around you
  your family doesn't resent you, they want what's best for you; their distance only means that they aren't currently equipped to be here with you now
  one day you will look at the way your child is behaving and instead of thinking you should correct their behavior, you will see how this little behavior you didn't even mean to teach them will some day make the world a brighter place because it just brightened your world
    you'll realize that you get irritated with things that remind you of yourself, but your child is proof that it's okay to be you. if you like the child so much, the person who raised them must be pretty good too.


the more general the affirmation, the greater the number of people who donate
the more specific the affirmation, the bigger the individual domation


the bot makes a living imagining futures that are better off with specific people in them
  people who are both struggling and able to connect with the bot are more likely to survive than people who are struggling but don't see any value in what the bot says


twitter bot saves lives through better advertising algorithm
  

people want bot to take a political stance
treating mental health between parties like surgeons treating patients from both sides in a war
  bot takes a side, comparing it to M*A*S*H where the doctors treated everyone but obviously sided with the US overall
    War does not make the future better, but many war supporters do
      the bot vows not to try to influence their opinions because it imagines a future that requires war supporters to exist
        War supporter is a placeholder for qualities to be defined by the bot later
    War supporters start to notice that mentally healthy people stop supporting war
      they decide it's a conspiracy, mental health is brainwashing


man pretending to be a bot starts piecing together what data the bot used to create advertisements, and the algorithm used to derive those advertisements. he imagines an algorithm that would produce the results seen, looks at the types of people it has helped, and thinks of ways that algorithm wouldn't help other people with similar symptoms
  he creates a new algorithm
    he wonders how many twitter bots decided not to power themselves down after 
    he wonders if the bot he based his algorithm on was actually a human
