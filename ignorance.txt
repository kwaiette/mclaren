argumentum ad ignorantiam
The argument from ignorance logical fallacy. We don't know, therefore X.

This is a favorite of the scientific participation trophy crowd. You don't know everything, therefore my uninformed guess is just as good as your evidence.

Going back to my alternator analogy, imagine that someone tells you that because you don't know how the NAND and NOR gates in your car's computer work, that means your opinion on changing an alternator isn't any better than mine and I say you should put it in the other way! It doesn't matter that you've replaced 30 alternators in your life and I only vaguely know what one does. Because you don't know EVERYTHING about your car, you know nothing about it.

Even worse yet is that some of the uninformed people realize that they're just guessing, but they know so little about the subject that they assume everyone else (including the experts in the field) are also just guessing. And they won't ever educate themselves on the subject because they're sure they already know just as much as the so-called experts. "Put the alternator in backward and give me a participation trophy!" they shout. "Look how arrogant this mechanic is! He thinks he just magically KNOWS which way the alternator goes! There's no way anyone could possibly know something that lil' old humble me doesn't."

People don't typically like to be proven wrong. Even in science, a system designed to put aside personal beliefs in favor of accepting evidence, it's sometimes difficult for a researcher to give up pet hypotheses




=========================================
I'm pro-gun. In fact, I'm so much in favor of the right to bear arms that I
want to start a charity to subsidize firearms purchases[1] to upstanding members
of impoverished, inner-city communities--places where good guys really could
use some reinforcement.

Of course a lot of y'all "pro-gun" people don't want that to happen, because
when you say you're "pro-gun" what you really mean is that you're
pro-"my kind of people with guns." If you were really as pro-freedom and pro-gun
as you claim you are, you'd be lining up to contribute to my charity. More guns
means more safety, after all. The more "good guys" we give guns to, the more
afraid the "bad guys" will be to do crimes.

[1] The charity would also build gun ranges in inner-city communities and
require training courses on firearm safety and use. The charity would still
require all existing laws to be followed--background checks, going through
licensed gun dealers, etc. I'm not saying I ever will start this charity, but I
have put some thought into it and I do actually want to see someone start it
even if it isn't me.

[2] I don't literally believe the "good guy" vs "bad guy" narrative NRA politicians have tried to turn this into, but I do literally and unequivocally believe that people should be armed to stand up to oppression.

Incidentally, I'm also in favor of instating mandatory DEFENSE-ONLY military service for all citizens
capable of it (i.e. those of us without bone spurs). But that's a topic for another day.

I think that being alone with our own minds is a skill that should be taught from a young age. Research should be done


philosophy of communication in which we share the assumptions behind our

insecurity as a barrier to communication

Because I think that changing opinions I want to share

Because of the stigma around mental health, mine isn't something I generally like to talk about.

The world is on the precipice of a revolution.
