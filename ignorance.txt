argumentum ad ignorantiam
The argument from ignorance logical fallacy. We don't know, therefore X.

This is a favorite of the scientific participation trophy crowd. You don't know everything, therefore my uninformed guess is just as good as your evidence.

Going back to my alternator analogy, imagine that someone tells you that because you don't know how the NAND and NOR gates in your car's computer work, that means your opinion on changing an alternator isn't any better than mine and I say you should put it in the other way! It doesn't matter that you've replaced 30 alternators in your life and I only vaguely know what one does. Because you don't know EVERYTHING about your car, you know nothing about it.

Even worse yet is that some of the uninformed people realize that they're just guessing, but they know so little about the subject that they assume everyone else (including the experts in the field) are also just guessing. And they won't ever educate themselves on the subject because they're sure they already know just as much as the so-called experts. "Put the alternator in backward and give me a participation trophy!" they shout. "Look how arrogant this mechanic is! He thinks he just magically KNOWS which way the alternator goes! There's no way anyone could possibly know something that lil' old humble me doesn't."

People don't typically like to be proven wrong. Even in science, a system designed to put aside personal beliefs in favor of accepting evidence, it's sometimes difficult for a researcher to give up pet hypotheses




=========================================
I'm pro-gun. In fact, I'm so much in favor of the right to bear arms that I
want to start a charity to subsidize firearms purchases[1] to upstanding members
of impoverished, inner-city communities--places where good guys really could
use some reinforcement.

Of course a lot of y'all "pro-gun" people don't want that to happen, because
when you say you're "pro-gun" what you really mean is that you're
pro-"my kind of people with guns." If you were really as pro-freedom and pro-gun
as you claim you are, you'd be lining up to contribute to my charity. More guns
means more safety, after all. The more "good guys" we give guns to, the more
afraid the "bad guys" will be to do crimes.

[1] The charity would also build gun ranges in inner-city communities and
require training courses on firearm safety and use. The charity would still
require all existing laws to be followed--background checks, going through
licensed gun dealers, etc. I'm not saying I ever will start this charity, but I
have put some thought into it and I do actually want to see someone start it
even if it isn't me.

[2] I don't literally believe the "good guy" vs "bad guy" narrative NRA politicians have tried to turn this into, but I do literally and unequivocally believe that people should be armed to stand up to oppression.

Incidentally, I'm also in favor of instating mandatory DEFENSE-ONLY military service for all citizens
capable of it (i.e. those of us without bone spurs). But that's a topic for another day.

Because of the stigma around mental health, mine isn't something I generally like to talk about.

The world is on the precipice of a revolution.

==============================================
QUESTION EVERYTHING!

This is a tenet I firmly believe in. It's why I love science, a system built around questioning everything, including our own assumptions and beliefs. You don't have to "trust" scientists if you understand the evidence.

Unfortunately it seems like most people who claim this as a principle actually believe in "Deny anything fact-based!" and "Accept the first thing that comes along that matches my beliefs."

Don't trust Big Pharma? Good! Me neither. But apply your same skepticism of greed motivation to Big Alterna, a $69 billion industry.

Don't trust climate science? Great! Learn about it and make reasoned arguments instead of saying "The weather just changes, man," as if the people studying it their entire lives are going to smack their foreheads and exclain, "Of course! Weather changes! Why didn't I think of that!" Think it's all a big conspiracy to put money in scientists' pockets? Okay... now turn that around and look at just how many billions are involved in denying evidence of climate science.

Don't trust the government? Hell no, I don't either! That's why my favorite things about government are the checks and balances built into it. It's why politicians need to be held accountable and investigations are so important. Now pay attention to who it is trying to undermine these checks and balances. The press is often affectionately called "the fourth branch of government"

ideas have survival strategies
republican conservatism has realized it can't survive against news and facts
it has adopted survival strategies like labeling all contradictory information as liberal conspiracies

I wonder how far science communication could get if we all just collectively agree that "we can't be certain but based on all evidence and models we have, there's a 99% probability" is functionally equivalent to "I dunno, but it seems to me like"
  in the mind of the scientist, the first means about the same thing as the second means to other people
    both are qualifying statements
    each person is about as sure of their conclusion as the other is
    the second is more effective in convincing other people

the god Nwnw was once like you
not a man, but a mortal
she was the fastest swimmer in her tribe
because of her speed and grace she was chosen by a lesser god
  to imagine a form that would travel swiftly through water
  then shape that form out of clay
this lesser god Gmgm selected other fast swimmers from other realms and gave them the same task
  Nwnw's form was selected above all other forms presented to Gmgm
    because it was sleek and swift
    and could carry other forms as passenger

gay bars closed

  [another head hangs lowly]
isolation
bars can open, but only so many at a time because covid
people flock to the gay bar because when they're finally allowed to be around people again
that's where they want to be
around people like them
  [you're so very special but I'm a creep]
because entry is limited, more gay bars pop up
but it's subgroups of the people who used to hang out at the gay bars
mixed with friends of theirs who always wished they had found the time to go to the gay bars
and it's not really gay bars, it's people in their living rooms, having drinks
a more intimate, more distributed, less communal kind of vibe
but still, the idea of the gay bar is what binds them
  [nobody said it was easy]
they talk about how they owe it to the gay bar--to themselves--to go to the gay bar again
once this is over
perhaps they will
