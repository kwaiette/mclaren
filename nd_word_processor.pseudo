      meta algorithm
        new card here
        let's compare it to all the cards we already have
          loop through algorithms
            loop through existing cards
     user input needed:
       is this a match?
         bi-directional match?
       would you like to combine these two cards to make a new card?
         two separate cards can still be found (transparency and background [smaller size vanishing point] indicating parent relation)
           unlike traditional "children are meant to be seen and not heard" it's "parents are meant to be barely seen and barely heard"
    algorithm
      word match
      length of text
      blackbox interface rule:
        given text T
        produce a score S:=0-100 (possibly representing a percent match)
          sed/awk commands?
          lisp?
          ifttt?
where did that come from and why is it related to this?

using human thought to fill inthe parts of AI
UI
  possible related cards hover in periphery
  on the left of the screen are matches that scored higher because of temporal proximity
  on the bottom of the screen are cards that didn't match as well but have been neglected
  on the right of the screen
    left-right axis: time-match
      3d projection into a 2d concept
        putting two incompatible measurements on the same axis creates a new dimension
          "importance" or "weight"
            time is 2d, it's both the 4th and 5th dimension
              4th dimention is bidirectional nature of time
                5th dimension is created by putting the unrelated forces
                  causality and its opposite
                on the same axis
  edit mode, drag/traverse mode

humans exist to predict the future
  that is,
    predictanticipate
      contrasted with portmantou predicipate
        new word replaces old words and gets new meaning
      predictanticipate encompasses entirety of both words
        //maybe related to card relationships


I think I invented a software design that will help people like me organize their thoughts
  imagined telling this to a friend
  realized there was some importance to putting it into words

lose specific memories and in their place we have summaries and conclusions
  sometimes summaries are lost too, and conclusions are obfuscated
    brain tickle: I know this means something, but I can't figure out why I know that!


famous philosopher Friedrich von Bullshit
 (made up name to make this bullshit
placebo is a story to tell
what about using a story as a panacea?
  jesus was a failed hypothesis
    a story that makes people good
    a story that makes people feel like they are good
      societies are collective organisms that exist on a much larger timescale than we do
a cure that cures you by telling you it's a cure
        the more we imagine the rest of humanity as a part of us
        the more conscious the organisms become
          organisms (cultures) overlap, are not distinct
            two sponges, seived and mixed together, become one or mix?

sneed:
simple

conservative
con
  word overlap association pun
  gives a negative connotation to a neutral word
    conjures to mind an overlap of conservatives and cons


typeos are interruptions

p2p document connections facilitated by hosted website but traffic p2p

turn connections into cards and use cards as intermediate connectors
cards
  (apple)
  (pear)
  connection (apple)<->[fruit]<->(pear)
automatically suggest turning
problem:
  the more objects to check, the slower it goes
    heuristic: hierarchies of broad categories to check instead of checking each individual object
	  determined by which words in this object are most likely to define it
	    given their appearance vs relative frequency

object relationships:
  peers

handshake
  depth allowed
  license
  gpg, certificate authority

translate wikipedia, tvtropes, kym

mvp:
  basic text editor with connectors
  basic web page reader with visual links
    using transparency
	relevant card weight as page scrolls
	  wikipedia translation use case: show blurb and picture (if available)
        next layer: user-suggested connections to other pages
		  user's "bookmarks"
	  scroll percentage, xy position of link on page
	    all done in-browser, not server side, can be served as static html and javascript
		  browser add-on?  fullscreen?

programmable connection heuristics
  human gets final say on if connected and type of connection
    type of connection could be a placeholder, to be defined later
	  I think these three things are connected (hypothesis) but I'm not sure how yet
	    background (z axis) peripheral connection suggestions could try to form connections from dictionary definitions

software defined as objects and interactions
  interactions can be represented by an object

code-as-process-as-code

might

next-level compiler
  connection to a node can trigger an event (external program, code snippet, etc)


connection heuristic, type subjective and categorical
  connection between A and B is humor
  difference between A and B and similarity between A and B are both types of connections

publish
  hides lower level
  publish level different for different subscribers

lock certain memories (cards from the past) from being brought up
  create broad categories
    something from this category matched your current card, do you want to see?
	  repressed memories
	  hard block vs soft block
	    hard block won't even show that the category matched

just start writing what you're thinking
when you think a new thought, make a new card
  connection type can be a placeholder for now
