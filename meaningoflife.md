on 5/12 I wept
there is much work ahead of us, but the path is clear

ENTRYPOINT
I've figured out the meaning of life
Well, not THE meaning
Life has lots of meanings, and there are many yet to be discovered
	Many of them even more profound than this one, I'm sure

I'm writing this in my voice
Which is a product of so many others I've been exposed to
Because the meaning of life could only be deduced by being exposed to so many ideas
Mainly right now I'm channeling Douglas Adams
	By way of Stephen Fry

Part of the reason I'm writing about the voice in my head is scaffolding
But we'll get to that later

So why don't I just run out and tell the world?
Well:
	(a) I'm not absolutely _positive_ it will change the world
	(b) I believe that if it is going to change the world, it has to have a narrative to go with it
	(c) I'm afraid that if it doesn't have the accompanying narrative, it will fizzle and die with me if I run around telling everyone

Maybe a table of contents should go here
